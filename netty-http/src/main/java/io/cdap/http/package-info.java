/**
 * Service and components to build Netty based Http web service.
 * {@code NettyHttpService} sets up the necessary pipeline and manages starting, stopping,
 * state-management of the web service.
 *
 * <p>
 * In-order to handle http requests, {@code HttpHandler} must be implemented. The methods
 * in the classes implemented from {@code HttpHandler} must be annotated with Jersey annotations to
 * specify http uri paths and http methods.
 * Note: Only supports the following annotations:
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.Path Path},
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.PathParam PathParam},
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.GET GET},
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.PUT PUT},
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.POST POST},
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.DELETE DELETE},
 *
 * {@link io.cdap.http.RequiredRoles RequiredRoles},
 * {@link io.cdap.http.Secured Secured}.
 *
 * Note: Doesn't support getting Annotations from base class if the HttpHandler implements also extends
 * a class with annotation.
 *
 * Sample usage Handlers and Netty service setup:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //Setup Handlers
 *
 * {@literal @}Path("/common/v1/")
 * public class ApiHandler implements HttpHandler {
 *
 *   {@literal @}Path("widgets")
 *   {@literal @}GET
 *   public void widgetHandler(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder) {
 *     responder.sendJson(HttpResponseStatus.OK, "{\"key\": \"value\"}");
 *   }
 *
 *   {@literal @}Override
 *   public void init(HandlerContext context) {
 *     //Perform bootstrap operations before any of the handlers in this class gets called.
 *   }
 *
 *   {@literal @}Override
 *   public void destroy(HandlerContext context) {
 *    //Perform teardown operations the server shuts down.
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * //Set up and start the http service
 * NettyHttpService service = NettyHttpService.builder()
 *                                            .addHttpHandlers(ImmutableList.of(new Handler())
 *                                            .setPort(8989)
 *                                            .build();
 * service.start();
 *
 * // ....
 *
 * //Stop the web-service
 * service.shutdown();
 *
 * </pre>
